1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

* Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: _How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?_

__Tools:__ R for data cleaning, Tableau for data visualization.

__Dataset:__ [![Cyclistic’s historical trip data from January 2022 to December 2022]()](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
